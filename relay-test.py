# A simple Python application for controlling a relay board from a Raspberry Pi
# The application uses the GPIO Zero library (https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
# The relay is connected to one of the Pi's GPIO ports, then is defined as an Output device
# in GPIO Zero: https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api_output.html#outputdevice

# create a relay object.
# Triggered by the output pin going low: active_high=False.
# Initially off: initial_value=False
relay = gpiozero.OutputDevice(RELAY_PIN, active_high=False, initial_value=False)
